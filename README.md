# urunit: A minimal init for Linux guests in urunc

This repository contains the code of `urunit`, a simple init process designed
for Linux guests running over [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc). It
acts as a reaper and correctly prepares and forwards command-line arguments
to the target application.

### Features

The key features of `urunit` are:

- Parsing and grouping multi-word arguments from Linux kernel boot parameters.
- Launching and waiting for the target application until it terminates.
- Reaping all zombie processes.
- Setting the default route to eth0, if `URUNIT_DEFROUTE` environment variable
  is set.
- Reading and setting the environment variables for an application from a file.
- Reading and setting the execution environment configuration for a process from a file.
- Reading and mounting attached block devices defined in the configuration file.
- Starting the agent at `/run/urunc/urunit-agent`, when present, as its own
  child before the application (e.g. the `urunc exec` agent) and reaping it.
  Once the application exits the agent is sent `SIGTERM`, and `urunit` waits,
  as always, for every remaining child before shutting down.

## Building

Building `urunit` is as simple as running `make`, but make sure that `make` and
a C compiler is installed. In particular:

- `make static`: builds `urunit` as a statically-linked binary
- `make static_debug`: builds `urunit` as a statically-linked binary enabling debug messages
- `make dynamic`: builds `urunit` as a dynamically-linked binary
- `make dynamic_debug`: builds `urunit` as a dynamically-linked binary enabling debug messages


> **NOTE**: The default build target is `make static`, hence running `make`
> will build `urunit` statically.

## Usage

To use `urunit`, prefix it before the application you want to run.
For instance, to run a `ls` command:

```
urunit ls
```

There are no arguments specifically for `urunit`. The first argument is treated
as the application to execute with the rest passed as arguments to that
application.

### Multi-word CLI arguments

One of the main purposes of `urunit` is to support multi-word CLI arguments
passed via `urunc` to an application in a Linux VM. Since the Linux kernel
cannot differentiate multi-word arguments in boot parameters (treating each
word as a separate argument), `urunc` follows a convention: multi-word arguments
are enclosed in single quotes. `urunit` then reassembles them properly before
execution.

For example, running:

```
urunit echo `hello world`
```

will result in `echo` receiving a single argument: `hello world`.

### Urunit configuration file

In order to configure the execution environment for an application, `urunit`
accepts a specific configuration file. The configuration file can contain the
following information:

- The list of the environment variables to set for the application
- The configuration for the process execution environment.
- The list of mounts of block devices. Each block device is defined by its
  serial id and it will get mounted in the defined mountpoint.

The file can be specified to `urunit` setting the `URUNIT_CONFIG`
environment variable with the path to the configuration file.

The supported format of the configuration file is the following:

```
UES
/* list of environment variables */
UEE
UCS
UID: <uid_for_the_application>
GID: <gid_for_the_application>
WD:  <working_directory>
UCE
UBS
ID: <serial_id>
MP: <mountpoint>
...
UBE
```

## Installation

Using one of the following methods, we can install `urunit` either in a
container image or in any other supported target.

### Building from source

Simply running:

```
make
make install
```

will build and install `urunit` at /usr/local/bin/`. You can override the
installation path using the `PREFIX` variable.

### Downloading prebuilt binaries

Each release includes statically linked binaries for x86_64 and aarch64.
Download and install with:

```
wget -O /usr/local/bin/urunit https://github.com/nubificus/urunit/releases/download/v0.1.0/urunit_x86_64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/urunit
```

### Using a container image

For easier distribution of `urunit`, the
`harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/urunit:latest` contains a statically built version of `urunit` at `/urunit`. To extract it into another container:

```
FROM harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/urunit:latest AS urunit
...
COPY --from=urunit /urunit /urunit
```
